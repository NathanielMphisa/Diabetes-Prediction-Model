# Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has diabetes using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains various medical predictor variables such as the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, and age.

## Context

The Pima Indians Diabetes Database is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The primary objective is to predict diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.  The dataset is limited to females of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and older.

## Content

The dataset includes several medical predictor variables and a target variable, `Outcome`, indicating whether the patient has diabetes.

## Libraries Used

* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Numpy
* Keras
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

## Key Features

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis
* Model building and training (using Keras)
* Model evaluation

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pip install pandas seaborn numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib`).
3.  Place the `diabetes.csv` dataset in the appropriate directory.
4.  Run the Jupyter Notebook `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb` to reproduce the results.
